    "**Purpose**: AI-powered property matching application that finds homes based on natural language user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Components**:\n",
    "- Natural language preference collection\n",
    "- AI-powered preference parsing (GPT-3.5)\n",
    "- Vector database search (ChromaDB with OpenAI embeddings)\n",
    "- Property recommendation generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database & Embeddings**:\n",
    "- Property listings from `house_listings.csv` are loaded and split into chunks\n",
    "- Each listing is converted to embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model\n",
    "- Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB vector database for semantic similarity search\n",
    "- User preferences are parsed and converted to a query embedding\n",
    "- System finds matching properties using cosine similarity in the embedding space\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Selection Chain**:\n",
    "- A QA (Question-Answering) chain is used to analyze the top matching properties\n",
    "- The chain evaluates all candidate listings against user preferences\n",
    "- GPT-3.5 generates the final recommendation, selecting the best advertisement for the user\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: \n",
    "- User is prompted to enter home preferences in natural language\n",
    "- If user enters nothing (empty input), the system uses the default input:\n",
